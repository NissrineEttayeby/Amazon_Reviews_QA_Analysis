<img width="478" alt="rev1" src="https://github.com/NissrineEttayeby/Spark_Projects/assets/108592629/00862897-fb42-4912-8652-9335773494d8">


# Objective
This project was implemented using **Databricks**, **PySpark**, and **Python**. The primary objective is to predict product ratings based on the review text. This project works with data from the "CDs and vinyl" category sourced from the Amazon product reviews dataset. The dataset will be divided into training and test data for model evaluation.

# Data
The Amazon product reviews dataset from the provided [link](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) is utilized for this project, focusing on the "CDs and vinyl" category. The dataset is split into training and test sets to facilitate model training and evaluation.

# Description
This project employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze review text and predict corresponding ratings. The goal is to establish a relationship between the sentiment expressed in the reviews and the numeric ratings assigned by users. The predictive model developed in this project provides insights into the connection between textual content and user satisfaction.

![QA2](https://github.com/NissrineEttayeby/Spark_Projects/assets/108592629/1a7aad03-9e39-49f5-aa81-572815b7f1e9)

# Objective
This project was implemented using **Databricks**, **PySpark**, and **Python**. The main objective is to perform automatic classification on question/answer data from the Amazon product QA dataset. The classification task involves varying the number of groups and examining the relevance of these groups.

# Data
This project utilizes the Amazon product QA dataset from the provided [link](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) The dataset contains question and answer pairs related to various products. The goal is to leverage this data for classification tasks and explore the significance of different grouping approaches.

# Description
Through the use of machine learning and classification techniques, this project categorizes questions and answers into relevant groups. By experimenting with different group numbers, the project aims to identify meaningful classifications and assess their practicality and effectiveness. The project provides valuable insights into organizing and structuring question/answer data to enhance user experience and facilitate information retrieval.
